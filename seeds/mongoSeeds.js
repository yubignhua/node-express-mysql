# Building Interactive 3D Experiences with React Three Fiber

React Three Fiber has revolutionized how we create 3D experiences in React applications. In this post, we'll explore how to build engaging 3D interfaces that respond to user interactions.

## Getting Started

First, let's set up our basic 3D scene:

\`\`\`jsx
import { Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber'
import { OrbitControls } from '@react-three/drei'

function Scene() {
  return (
    <Canvas>
      <ambientLight intensity={0.5} />
      <pointLight position={[10, 10, 10]} />
      <OrbitControls />
      <mesh>
        <boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />
        <meshStandardMaterial color="orange" />
      </mesh>
    </Canvas>
  )
}
\`\`\`

## Adding Interactivity

The real magic happens when we add user interactions...
